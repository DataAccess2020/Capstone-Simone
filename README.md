# Capstone-Simone
More than an organic project, it's a set of ideas to develop. The common thread is football, from the on-field performance to the stands and the socio-political meanings of the game for the community of supporters.

The files are organized as following:

Data folder <- contain the data used in the analysis
Figs folder <- contain the figures used in the report
Report folder <- contain the markdown and the html file
Scripts <- contain the scripts ordered numerically
